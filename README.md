## Recent Advances in Difference-in-Differences at ISR

Welcome to my one-day course on difference-in-differences at ISR at the University of Michigan. 

This will be a four-hour workshop that will involve three main components: lectures, a coding exercise, and an "online office hour" for your unique DiD Q&A. 

The exact timing will depend on how many questions people ask, but a rough outline of the planned schedule is as follows: 


All times Eastern Time.

- 9-10:15 **Lecture 1: Testing the Parallel Trends Assumption: Issues and Limitations**
- 10:15-10:30 **Break**
- 10:30-11:45 **Lecture 2: New Approaches When Parallel Trends May Be Violated**
- 11:45-12:15 **Coding Exercise**
- 12:15-1 **Open "Office Hours" (Q&A)**


## Coding Exercise Instructions

The coding exercise we will do today is [Exercise 2](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/tree/main/Exercises/Exercise-2#exercise-2-violations-of-parallel-trends) from my Advanced DiD class taught through MixTape Sessions. This coding exercise considers methods for sensitivity analysis for violations of the parallel trends assumption using the **HonestDiD** package. (You are welcome to try Exercise 1 on your own, which covers new methods for settings with staggered treatment timing.) 

The data for Exercise 2 is the same as for Exercise 1, so you should first look at the Exercise 1 [instructions](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/tree/main/Exercises/Exercise-1#data) for loading the data, then flip back to [Exercise 2](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/tree/main/Exercises/Exercise-2#exercise-2-violations-of-parallel-trends). 

The instructions tell you what to do in both R and Stata. You can find the solutions available here: [Stata](https://raw.githack.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/main/Exercises/Exercise-2/Solutions/medicaid-analysis-pt-violations-solutions-stata.html) [R](https://raw.githack.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Advanced-DID/main/Exercises/Exercise-2/Solutions/medicaid-analysis-pt-violations-solutions-stata.html)
