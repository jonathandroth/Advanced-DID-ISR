  Welcome to the Recent Advances in Difference-in-Differences Workshop!

  \medskip
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I am excited to learn with you all today.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Who Am I?}
  \begin{wideitemize}

    \item
    Assistant Professor of Economics at Brown University.

    \item
    I consider myself an \textit{applied econometrician}.

    \item
    The main goal of my research is to develop \textit{usable} tools that improve the quality of empirical work.

  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{My DiD Journey}

  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    Early-on in graduate school, I was an aspiring labor economist running a lot of DiDs...

  \end{wideitemize}

\begin{frame}{My DiD Journey}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    I realized I had a lot of questions about the methodology of what I was doing.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Should I believe parallel trends holds in this context?

      \item
            Why do I have pre-trends in some of my specifications but not others?

      \item
            Is it okay if I focus only on the specifications without pre-trends...?
    \end{itemize}

    \pause
    \item Pretty quickly I started writing methodological papers about these topics
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            I never published the Act 10 paper -- oops!
    \end{itemize}

    \item But the goal of my research has always been to try to inform real-world analyses of economic topics

    \pause
    \item Today I hope to share with you some of the insights that I and others have learned over the last few years, with the \textbf{goal of helping you improve your research.}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Focus on both theory and applying it in practice!
    \end{itemize}

  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{(Approximate) Schedule}
All times Eastern Time. \bigskip 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 9-9:15 Introduction: Overview of Recent Advances in DiD 
	\item 9:15-10:15 Lecture 1: Testing the Parallel Trends Assumption: Issues and Limitations
	\item 10:15-10:30 Break

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Course logistics}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    I strongly encourage you all to participate and ask questions!
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            It's more fun for me and helps you learn better!
    \end{itemize}
    \item
    There are several ways that you can ask questions:

    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item
      Raise hand on Zoom

      \item
      Put questions in chat
    \end{wideitemize}

    \item
    I will pause periodically for you to ask live questions and to review messages in chat
  \end{wideitemize}

\begin{frame}{What's trending in difference-in-differences?}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Difference-in-differences} (DiD) is one of the most popular strategies for estimating causal effects in non-experimental contexts.
    \medskip
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Used in over 20\% of NBER WPs \citep{currie_technology_2020}, and growing over time
    \end{itemize}

    \item
    The last few years have seen an explosion of econometrics on DiD, making it hard to keep up (sorry!)

    \item
    In Roth, Sant'Anna, Bilinski, and Poe (Forthcoming JOE), we attempted to synthesize the recent literature and provide concrete recommendations for practitioners


    \item
    Today's workshop will focus mainly on the developments in Section 4 of that paper, on violations of parallel trends. But first, a helicopter tour...
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Canonical DiD}
	The econometrics of DiD have been understood for a long time in what I'll call the ``canonical DiD'' model. In this model: \medskip
	
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item
		\textbf{Timing:} There are 2 periods; treatment occurs (for some units) in period 2
		
		\item
		\textbf{Identification:} Obtain ID of the ATT using parallel trends and no anticipation
		
		\item
		\textbf{Estimation and Inference:} With many clusters, OLS with TWFE gives consistent estimates and valid CIs
		
	\end{wideitemize}
\medskip
\pause
\noindent The canonical model is great... but typically doesn't match settings that people study in practice
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Characterizing the recent literature}
  Recent work on DiD has tried to make the econometrics more realistic by relaxing one (or more) component of the standard model: 
  \medskip

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    \textbf{Multiple periods and staggered treatment timing}
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item 
    		{\footnotesize E.g. \citet[][]{borusyak_revisiting_2016, de_chaisemartin_difference--differences_2020, callaway_difference--differences_2020, sun_estimating_2020,goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2018,borusyak_revisiting_2021}}
    	\end{itemize}

    \item
    \textbf{Relaxing or allowing PT to be violated}
       \begin{itemize}
       	\item 
       	{\footnotesize E.g. \citet{roth_pre-test_2021,rambachan_more_2023,kahn-lang_promise_2020,bilinski_no_2018,freyaldenhoven_pre-event_2019,ye_negative_2021,manski_how_2017} }
       \end{itemize}

    \item
    \textbf{Inference with a small number of clusters}
     \begin{itemize}
     	\item 
     	{\footnotesize E.g. \citet{donald_inference_2007,Conley2011,Ferman2018,Hagemann2020,Hagemann2021}}
     \end{itemize}

  \end{enumerate}
  \medskip
  Will focus today on \#2. See the DiD Resources page on \hyperlink{https://www.jonathandroth.com/did-resources/}{my website} for much more!
